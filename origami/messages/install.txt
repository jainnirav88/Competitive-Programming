Origami
   the art of folding paper

https://github.com/SublimeText/Origami

Origami is a new way of thinking about panes in Sublime Text:
you tell Sublime Text where you want a new pane, and it makes one for you.
It works seamlessly alongside the built-in layout commands.

All commands are available under the View>Origami menu, as well as in the
command palette (search for Origami).

Keybindings also exist for most commands. Origami shortcuts start by pressing
and releasing ctrl+k (or cmd+k), followed by a second shortcut, like this:
 * ctrl/cmd+k, then an arrow: move focus to the pane in that direction
 * ctrl/cmd+k, then shift+arrow: move the current file to the destination
 * ctrl/cmd+k, then alt/option+arrow: clone the current file to the destination
 * ctrl/cmd+k, then ctrl/cmd+arrow: create an adjacent pane
 * ctrl/cmd+k, then ctrl/cmd+shift+arrow: destroy an adjacent pane
